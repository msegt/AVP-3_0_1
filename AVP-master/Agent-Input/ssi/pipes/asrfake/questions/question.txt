Hi! How are you? 
My name is [your name]. And yours?
Alice? Like Alice in Wonderland?
Then you should know a lot about it.
That is nice to know. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions?
Who wrote Alice in Wonderland?
He also wrote Through the Looking Glass, right?
I have forgotten quite a lot of things about the book, but I remember a long and sad tale. That is in Alice in Wonderland, correct?
Do you remember who told the tale to Alice?
Yes, please!
There were also a character in the book who kept appearing and disappearing. What was its name?
Yes! The Cheshire cat. What a curious character ... I also recall the mad Hatter, the one with a card on his hat showing ten divided by six. Do you know what does that mean?
That is fantastic! Thank you so much. I always wanted to know that!
It was really nice to talk to you and recall the book. It was also nice to meet you, Alice.
That would be nice. See you soon then.
