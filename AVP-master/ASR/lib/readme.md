Directory contents
-------------------

This directory contains all the necessary shared libraries 
that are linked to by the executables in bin dir. These shared
object (.so) files are collected by analyzing the dependencies
of the original binaries compiled on a 64 bit Ubuntu 2012 based
Linux machine.

Note: some needed libraries will be already provided by your Linux
distributioin.
