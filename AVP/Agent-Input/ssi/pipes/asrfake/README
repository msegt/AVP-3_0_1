This pipeline fakes speech recognition.

Sentences are line-by-line read from a text file and send after a voice activity event is detected.

The file with the sentences is currently found in 'questions/question'.

To change the dialogue use the scripts 'mk_questions.pl' & 'mk_answers.pl' in questions/ & answers/ and replace the wav files in answers/ accordingly.

When running the pipeline make sure to:

1. use a headphone
2. set headphone speakers as default audio playback device
3. read out loud red sentences (a microphone will be displayed)
4. listen while Alice is talking (if activity is detected in between this will mess up the recording)

-------------------------------------------------------------

To record videos of screen/user execute ASRFAKE_RECORD.bat

Recorded files will be stored in capture/ 

See camera.png how to set up camera

As second audio device select "Stereo mix" (only works for headsets that are connected to the soundcard)
