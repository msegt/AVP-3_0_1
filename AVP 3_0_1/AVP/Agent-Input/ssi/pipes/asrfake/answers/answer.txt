Hello! I am fine thanks. What is your name?
Hi! My name is Alice.
Exactly. I love that book. I read it a million times.
Well, I know the story by heart ... and some curiosities about the book as well.
Of course not. 
That's easy. It was Lewis Carol. Actually, his real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson.
Yes, he did.
Yes, it is in Chapter three if I remember well - a Caucus-Race and a Long Tale.
Sure. It was the Mouse. Shall I read you a passage? 
'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again. 'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing. 'It is a long tail, certainly,' said Alice
You mean the Cheshire Cat? 
The card is a price tag in old English money. It means ten shillings and six pence. This meaning is explained in a shorter version of the book called The Nursery Alice, also by Lewis Carroll. 
Your are very welcome.
Same here. I also enjoyed our conversation. Hope to see you again. I could read the book for you if you want.
Bye, bye!
