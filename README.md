This project will become an installer for the Aria Valuspa Platform v3.0.1, but it is currently on early stages of development.

The purpose of this installer is to copy the relevant folder structure to the installation directory, and will be part of a bundle installer that will check for dependencies and install them if necessary as well.

It has been created using the WiX toolkit and Microsoft Visual Studio.
